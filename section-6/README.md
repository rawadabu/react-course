# What is State?

State is the most important concept in React.

## What is state and why do we need it?

State is a data that a component _can hold over time_, necessary for information that it needs to _remember_ throughout the app's lifecycle.
We can use it as a _memory_, to hold this data over time.
Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component.

- State is a _tool_. Mastering state will unlock the power of React development
