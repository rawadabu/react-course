# Section 3

Front-end web applications are all about handling data + displaying data in a user interface - > User interface needs to stay in sync with data.

So JavaScript front-end frameworks exists because keeping a user interface in sync with data is really hard and a lot of work, and front-end frameworks solve this problem(such as React, Angular, Vue etc...)

They enforce a "correct" way of structuring and writing code, and give developers and teams a consistent way of building front-end applications.

## What is React?

- Its JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Extremely popular, declarative, component-based, state-driven JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by _Facebook_.
- React is all about components(use them more than once), such as buttons, input fields, search bars and so on.
- We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called _JSX_.
- Declarative: telling React what a component should look like, based on current data/state.
- React is abstraction away from _DOM_: we never touch the DOM.
- _JSX_: a syntax that combines _HTML_ _CSS_ _JAVASCRIPT_ as well as referencing other components.
- State-driven: Example: array of apartments[STATE] -> Render -> UI[COMPONENT WRTIEN WITH JSX] -> Update State -> Back to [STATE] and Re-render again.

* REACT REACTS TO STATE CHANGES BY RE-RENDERING THE UI.\*
